I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at the University of Toronto and a member of the [University of Toronto Robotics Institute](https://robotics.utoronto.ca/). My researcher advisor is [Prof. Florian Shkurti](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~florian/), who directs the [Robot Vision & Learning Lab](https://rvl.cs.toronto.edu/). I am fortunate to be a recipient of the [2021-22 Vector Scholarship in Artificial Intelligence](https://vectorinstitute.ai/scholarship/) and the [Ontario Graduate Scholarship](https://www.sgs.utoronto.ca/awards/ontario-graduate-scholarship/).

My research interests are in Machine Learning and Computer Vision, particularly in the areas of self-supervised learning, visual perception, and self-driving vehicles. My goal is to develop machine learning techniques that are less reliant on manually labeled datasets and are more adaptable to new environments which may arise in real-world applications.

I completed my B.A.Sc. in Engineering Science, Robotics at the University of Toronto, where I did my undergraduate thesis with Prof. Florian Shkurti on self-supervised representation learning for human action videos. I also did a full-year internship at [Intel Corporation](https://www.intel.ca/content/www/ca/en/homepage.html), where I developed optimization algorithms for the High Level Design FPGA Compiler.
